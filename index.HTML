        She was Ellen’s very first guest a whopping 17 years ago, and now she’s
        guest hosting on the hit show for her beloved ‘real-life friend.’
        Jennifer Aniston looked sublime as she guest-hosted for Ellen DeGeneres
        on her hit daytime show Friday, while Ellen claimed she had to go to the
        DMV. Aniston also reminded the audience that The Ellen DeGeneres Show is
        filmed on the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank, which just so happened to
        have been Aniston’s professional home when she was filming Friends from
        1994 to 2004 ‘She throws pennies away. She throws them right into the
        garbage, in front of people,’ Jen exclaimed, poking fun at Ellen’s
        staggering financial success. ‘Good luck pennies!’ Another big ‘reveal’
        came when Aniston said, ‘I can’t even walk into her dressing room
        because she’s burning one of those Gwyneth Paltrow candles!’ After a few
        more jokey secrets, the Cake star began reminiscing about the past and
        shared a true ‘secret,’ or rather, little-known fact about her and
        Ellen: ‘I was actually Ellen’s very first guest on this show!’ She was
        referring to her September 8, 2003 appearance on Ellen’s show, which
        indeed was the first-ever episode of the long-running, Emmy
        Award-winning talk show.
